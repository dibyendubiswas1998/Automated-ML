# Project Name: Automated ML


## Project Description:
Automating the tasks of applying Machine Learning to solve real-world problems.

## Objectives:
Apply Automated ML or AutoML when you want to train and tune a model 
for you using the target metric you specify. Automated ML democratizes 
the machine learning model development process, and empowers its users,
no matter their data science expertise, to identify an end-to-end machine 
learning pipeline for any problem.

Data scientists, analysts, and business professionals across industries are 
used automated ML because:

    ● Implement ML solutions without extensive programming knowledge,

    ● AutoML gives best Machine Learning model,

    ● Business Professionals take instant dedecisions about data,

    ● Save time and resources,

    ● Leverage data science best practices,

    ● Provide agile problem-solving, etc.
